# Elastic Transcoder
> AWS service that allows users to convert media file from one format to another one or more  format. Only pay the bill for computing resources/per-minute.

* Pipeline: a queue for jobs is a basic unit in elastic transcoder
* Presets:  contain transcoder settings for varoius devices
* Allow one input file but output up to 30 files
* cost down, low admin overhead, don't want any upfront compute costs for transcoding media files

## Best practices
* Provide multiple pipeline for different priority of processing needs
