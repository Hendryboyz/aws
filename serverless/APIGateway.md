# API Gateway
* Restful: Have wider compatibility for general purpose
    * Stateless, Request and Response
* WebSocket: high throughput and a lot of transaction
  * Keep connection to communicate
* Allow to enable API cache to store the similar input and output to prevent the interaction with the backend service and function. This can be used to reduce the computing cost.
